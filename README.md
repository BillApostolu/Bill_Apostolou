#### Thesis: Heat risk assessment for cities in Greece. 
- A study aimed at evaluating thermal risk in urban areas using four indicators: Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), population density, and maximum temperatures during the warmest month. Using the K-means algorithm, the thermal risk was categorized into five to seven classes and analyzed across local climate zones. The findings support the adaptation of cities to climate change.
