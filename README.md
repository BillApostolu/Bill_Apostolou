## Education	        		
- B.S., Physics (240 ECTS) | National Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA) _(recommendation letter pending)_ _Period of attendance: 09/2019 – 06/2024_

## Objective
- Motivated physics major in the direction of environmental physics and renewable energy sources, particularly interested in atmospheric physics, renewable energies, modeling,  machine learning and data analysis. Having completed a demanding degree from the prestigious department of Physics in the National Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA), acquiring knowledge, managing data and solving problems in fields like statistics, hydrodynamics, atmospheric physics and dynamics, computational physics and renewable energies, I am ready to gain experience in the sector of data analytics and programming, aiming at developing modeling programs and broadening my knowledge of the industry.

## Relevant Coursework:
#### Thesis: Heat risk assessment for cities in Greece.
- In this thesis, a study was carried out with the aim of finding and evaluating thermal risk in cities. Four indicators were used to find the thermal risk. Specifically, these indices are related to land surface temperature LST, vegetation NDVI, population, and warmest month mean maximum temperature. The results of the four indicators were grouped using the K-means algorithm, assigning the thermal risk to five to seven classes, depending on the intensity of the thermal risk. In addition, these classes were associated with local climate zones, and for each zone characteristic values of the parameters that make up the thermal risk were extracted. The results can be used in studies of adaptation of cities to climate change.
