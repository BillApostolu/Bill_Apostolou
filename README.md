•	Thesis: Heat risk assessment for cities in Greece.
In this thesis, a study was carried out with the aim of finding and evaluating thermal risk in cities. The eight urban areas for which the thermal risk assessment was carried out concern the wider area of the most populous residential areas of Greece (Athens, Thessaloniki, Patras, Katerini, Kalamata, Heraklion, Lamia, Alexandroupoli) and cover all the geographical zones of the country. Four indicators were used to find the thermal risk. Specifically, these indices are related to land surface temperature LST, vegetation NDVI, population, and warmest month mean maximum temperature. The results of the four indicators were grouped using the K-means algorithm, assigning the thermal risk to five to seven classes, depending on the intensity of the thermal risk. In addition, these classes were associated with local climate zones, and for each zone characteristic values of the parameters that make up the thermal risk were extracted. The results can be used in studies of adaptation of cities to climate change.
